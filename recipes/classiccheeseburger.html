    <h3>Behind the dish</h3>
    <p>The cheeseburger found its start in 19th century America, where cattle ranching's expansion into the Great Plains provided ample access to beef in the American Diet. The Hamburger was an affordable result of this, and by the 1920's, a piece of cheese was placed on top of the patty, and the cheeseburger was born.</p>
